DESCRIPTION

E-voting is  an online voting web application developed using React JS and Solidity smart contracts where the process of decentralized voting system is implemented using the Blockchain technology.


DEVELOPMENT

→ Frontend:  Implemented using ReactJS.​

→ Backend:  Ethereum network is used via Metamask. Solidity is used for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.


BENEFITS OF USING E-VOTING

→  Increasing the level of participation​:

   The Internet voting system tends to maximize user  participation, by allowing them to vote from anywhere and from any device that has an internet connection.​
   
→  Security​:

   E-voting system is implemented using “Blockchain” which ensures the security.​
   
→ Efficiency​​:

  The reduction in organizational and implementation costs significantly increases the​ efficiency of election management compared to traditional paper voting, for example.​​
  
​→ Precision​​:

  The electronic vote eliminates errors in manual count, which brings with it​​ an accurate and quick publication of results, with receipt of vote for each vote cast.​
